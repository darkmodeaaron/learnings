const post280824 = "After applying for jobs over the past couple of weeks and receiving no replies, it is time to revise my application. Although this post will mostly be about my portfolio website and coding projects, my CV could definitely do with some work but I will save writing about that issue for another time. \n\n For the most part I like the design of my portfolio and how it functions. It is simple and clean with a small amount of functionality that showcases some of my ability to create UI features. I have tried to keep it short and minimal whilst including who I am, what I am (frontend developer) and a small bit on what I prioritise. I then include my skillset as soon as possible followed by my coding projects. \n\n I have designed it this way with the idea that whoever may be viewing it will have all the information they need within seconds of looking either on desktop or a mobile platform. Two big points I took from advice I saw online when make a portfolio website were making sure there is always a CTA in sight and peaking content that makes the user want to scroll too see more of. There are small changes I feel I need to make to layout of my skillset attributes but for the most part I am relatively pleased and don’t feel like this is where my problems may occur…\n\n To put it bluntly I believe that the main problem with my portfolio is that I don’t think my projects stand out, are creative enough or show enough skill to excite a potential employer (yikes). There is this project, the ‘Learnings Repository’ that I think has some cool and simple functionality and another original design that shows off some core HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge as a small introduction. There is a dummy e-commerce platform made using React that I made with the aim to show I can make some stereotypical features of what is on any site being responsive headers and footers, hamburger menus, a multipage site, UI features and a very very simple cart system mainly showing I can use localStorage. Then a band page that basically shows the same as the 'Learnings repository' and then a small web app which was my first project I used to dip my toe into Typescript and Tailwind CSS. Overall quite underwhelming. \n\n There is nothing showing I can write asynchronous code, nothing showing I can utilise API’s and nothing showing any back-end development skills (This may not be as relavent as I am applying for front-end jobs). Basically nothing showing off any of the more advanced concepts of front-end development. On top of this, the code inside these projects is lacking quality and shows I need to invest more time and effort into writing better quality code.\n\n When I made the decision to try and pursue a career in coding I never for one second thought that getting a job would be an easy feat. After recent weeks I am coming to to terms with how difficult it will become. Even knowing the amount of time I have spent staring at a screen trying to cram new knowledge into my head and produce projects that may impress I am going to have too raise these effort levels to an even higher bar. You often hear and read developers online talk about the never-ending learning journey developers must go on and I think I am starting to understand what this sentiment means.\n\n My next steps will be to revise what I already have, create a new plan of action for what is needed and come back with a better portfolio product to sell to potential employers.\n\n I will link below what my current portfolio looks like as of now.\n\n thanks for reading,\n aaron"
