It includes three projects I believe show the better side of my programming skills and hopefully my capability to learn. \n\n Moving forward I am looking to enhance my abilities in React whilst adding Typescript and Tailwind CSS to my skillset as these are featured on many many job applications. I have a few projects in my head I can create to help me learn these new skills which hopefully will not take me too long to become competent in.\n\n Also my aim is to add a new entry here every week from now. \n\n thanks for reading, \naaron'
